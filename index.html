      ◊ Offer valid on qualifying purchases of eligible Apple products from November 25, 2022, to November 28, 2022, at
      a qualifying location. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Customers shall receive a discount
      equal to the value of the Promotion Product (depending on their purchase) off the price of the Eligible Product,
      but will be charged for all items in their cart. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly
      statement for Apple Card Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: A purchase of an Eligible
      Product made when selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as the payment type at
      checkout will receive an instant credit equal to the cost of the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted from
      the price of the Eligible Product at the time of purchase. You will be charged one ACMI installment plan for the
      Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit. The value of the Promotion Product (i.e. the value of the Apple
      Gift Card) will also be charged in a separate second ACMI installment plan for the same number of months as the
      discounted Eligible Product. The total combined amount charged over the 2 separate ACMI installment plans will
      reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately, you will receive and be charged for
      the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) in the amount of the applicable instant credit. ACMI is subject to credit
      approval and credit limit. Variable APRs for Apple Card other than ACMI range from 13.99% to 24.99% based on
      creditworthiness. Rates as of October 1, 2022. If you choose the pay-in-full or one-time-payment option for an
      ACMI-eligible purchase instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout, that purchase will be subject
      to the variable APR assigned to your Apple Card. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI transactions and are
      subject to your standard purchase APR. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement at
      https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Apple-Card-Customer-Agreement.pdf for more information. ACMI is

      reside in the U.S. territories, please call Goldman Sachs at 877-255-5923 with questions about accessing this
      offer or applying for Apple Card. Except for ACMI, this offer cannot be combined with other Apple promotion(s) or
